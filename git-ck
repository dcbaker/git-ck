# Provides a simple wrapper around git checkout that saves and restores work in
# progress.

# When one calls git-ck on a branch with staged code, git-ck will commit that
# as a commit called 'git-ck: staged'. When one calls git-ck on a branch with
# unstaged code git-ck will commit that as 'git-ck: unstaged'.
